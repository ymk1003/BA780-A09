1391,161,MUX,IAX,2022-09-21,Delayed,Delayed,Atlantic,"Hey United, love you, so some heart to heart feedback... I thought I was ""paying extra for"" the business / Polaris class ice cream sundae cart!. And I miss it!. It was your brand. Post Covid it has disappeared. It was missing my Houston London round-trip back in April-May 2020 also. United has lost something by losing the ice cream cart. Did some cost accountant make the call?. My hypothesis is deleting the ice cream cart is the wrong business value / branding decision. Context:. 1. A 1998 Harvard Business Review article on the turnaround of Continental gave a credo that the airline would provide whatever ""... the customer in Seat 9C ... would pay extra for."". Well for our African safari trip I was willing to pay out of my pocket - not corporate expense account - for seats 3F and 3L for my wife and me. And I had two flights where my experience was interrupted with the nagging thought, ""Dang, $22,000 and no frigging ice cream sundae service. What are they thinking?"". Reference: Right Away and All at Once: How We Saved Continental (hbr.org). https://hbr.org/1998/09/right-away-and-all-at-once-how-we-saved-continental. 2. I have been taking Continental / United business class since the 1990s, sometimes opting it over Singapore Airlines. I am Million Miles plus. For personal vacation travel I have bought ""business"" seats for my wife and me to Beijing in 2019 and London this year in addition to this trip Houston-Newark-Johannesburg-Frankfurt-Munich-Houston. 3. The sundae was not that expensive yet something I have always looked forward to on United (and previously Continental) long haul business flights. And while a little staff-time intensive, it provided good interaction staff-customer interaction and built for me brand goodwill. 4. Surprisingly the premade chocolate sundae tasted decent on this flight and did in many aspects hit the spot. It was a good portion. And in the day I did always skip the nuts and cherry. So are you wondering if the premade sundae of vanilla ice cream with cold fudge (no whipped cream) was nice enough why bother with giving this feedback?. Think of it this way... Post Covid people want a return to normalcy. Bringing back the ice cream sundae cart would be a great way for United to reassure their core customers that things are normal back in the Friendly Skies... serving up what the customer in seat 9C will ""pay extra for."".",90+,Is there anything else you'd like to share about the food & beverage served on your flight from [CITY] to [CITY]?,premier platinum,B767-300,Mainline,member,Neutral,hey unit love heart heart feedback thought pay extra busi polari class ice cream sunda cart miss brand post covid disappear miss houston london back 2020 also unit lost someth lose ice cream cart cost account make call hypothesi delet ice cream cart wrong busi valu brand decis context 1998 harvard busi review articl turnaround continent gave credo airlin would provid whatev custom seat 9c would pay extra well african safari trip will pay pocket corpor expens account seat 3f 3l wife two flight experi interrupt nag thought dang frig ice cream sunda servic think refer right away save continent http take continent unit busi class sinc 1990 sometim opt singapor airlin million mile plu person vacat travel bought busi seat wife beij 2019 london year addit trip sunda expens yet someth alway look forward unit previous continent long haul busi flight littl intens provid good interact interact built brand goodwil surprisingli premad chocol sunda tast decent flight mani aspect hit spot good portion day alway skip nut cherri wonder premad sunda vanilla ice cream cold fudg whip cream nice enough bother give feedback think way post covid peopl want return normalci bring back ice cream sunda cart would great way unit reassur core custom thing normal back friendli sky serv custom seat 9c pay extra
